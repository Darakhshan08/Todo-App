# Update Constitution Phase2

## PROMPT_TEXT

Update the constitution file to reflect Phase 2 requirements for the Full-Stack Web Application instead of the Phase 1 CLI application.

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Updated the constitution file at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` to reflect Phase 2 requirements, changing from a CLI-based Todo application to a Full-Stack Web Application with Next.js frontend, FastAPI backend, Neon PostgreSQL database, and Better Auth authentication. Updated all core principles, technology stack, feature requirements, API contracts, and success criteria to align with Phase 2 objectives.
