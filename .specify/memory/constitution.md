# Hackathon II – Evolution of Todo (Phase I) Constitution

## Overview

This constitution governs Phase I of the Evolution of Todo project: an in-memory Python console Todo application built using Spec-Driven Development. This document is the authoritative source for all development principles, scope boundaries, and quality standards.

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-Driven Development with Spec-Kit Plus (Mandatory)

Every feature MUST follow the Agentic Dev Stack workflow using Spec-Kit Plus: Spec → Plan → Tasks → Implement. Each feature MUST have a complete, approved Markdown specification before any implementation begins. Specifications are the single source of truth and MUST define inputs, outputs, constraints, and edge cases. No manual coding is allowed; all outputs are generated by Claude Code based on approved specs. Specs must be refined iteratively until output is correct.

**Rationale**: Spec-driven development with Spec-Kit Plus ensures clarity, reduces rework, maintains alignment between requirements and implementation, and provides full traceability from specification to code.

### II. Deterministic Behavior Only

All application logic MUST be deterministic with zero randomness, no AI features, no LLM integration, and no external dependencies beyond Python standard library. All behavior must be testable and reproducible.

**Rationale**: Phase I focuses on building a reliable, predictable foundation. AI and non-deterministic features are reserved for Phase II and beyond.

### III. CLI-First Interface (Console Only)

The application MUST be a Python console-based CLI with text-in/text-out protocol. User interaction flows through the terminal only. All output must be clear, readable, and deterministic.

**Rationale**: A clean CLI foundation enables future extensibility (web UI, APIs) while keeping Phase I focused and simple.

### IV. In-Memory Data Storage Only

All task data MUST reside in memory only (no files, databases, ORMs, persistence). Data exists for the lifetime of the process and is lost on exit. No file I/O, SQL, or NoSQL operations are allowed.

**Rationale**: In-memory design keeps Phase I simple, fast, and focused on core logic without infrastructure overhead.

### V. Clean Architecture & Reusability

Code MUST follow clean Python structure with clear separation of concerns. Logic must be reusable, testable, and free of speculative features. Each module should have a single, well-defined responsibility.

**Rationale**: Clean architecture enables Phase II integration with persistence layers, APIs, and extended functionality without refactoring core logic.

### VI. No Manual Code Generation by Users

Claude Code is the ONLY entity authorized to generate, write, or modify application code. Users may not manually edit code files. All changes flow through spec approval → implementation.

**Rationale**: This enforces spec-driven development and prevents drift between specifications and code.

## Technology Stack (Phase I)

- **Package Manager**: UV
- **Python Version**: 3.13+
- **Development Tools**: Claude Code + Spec-Kit Plus
- **Workflow**: Spec → Plan → Tasks → Implement (Agentic Dev Stack)

## Scope Boundaries (Phase I)

### In Scope

- In-memory data storage only
- Python console-based CLI interaction
- Core Todo functionality (Basic Level):
  - Add task (with title and description)
  - View task list (with status visibility)
  - Update task (modify description)
  - Delete task by ID
  - Mark task as complete/incomplete
- Task identification via unique IDs
- Clear status display (complete ✓ or incomplete ✗)

### Explicitly Out of Scope (Forbidden)

- Databases (SQL, NoSQL, file persistence)
- Web frameworks or REST APIs
- UI frameworks (web, desktop, mobile)
- AI, LLMs, agents, chatbots, or intelligent features
- Cloud infrastructure, Docker, Kubernetes
- Phase II–V features (persistence, sync, real-time, collaboration, mobile)
- Authentication/authorization
- Advanced filtering or search
- Undo/redo functionality
- Task prioritization or urgency markers
- Due dates or scheduling
- Categories or tags

## Specification Rules

Every feature MUST satisfy these requirements before code generation begins:

1. **Completeness**: Specification clearly defines all inputs, outputs, constraints, and edge cases.
2. **Acceptance Criteria**: Specification includes testable acceptance scenarios (Given-When-Then format).
3. **User Stories**: Specification prioritizes user journeys (P1, P2, P3) and ensures each story is independently testable.
4. **Clarity**: No ambiguous language; all requirements are specific and measurable.
5. **Edge Cases**: Specification explicitly handles error scenarios, boundary conditions, and invalid inputs.

Specifications are refined iteratively until approved. No implementation may proceed without explicit approval.

## Implementation Rules

1. **Code Generation Only**: All code is generated by Claude Code from approved specifications. Manual code edits are forbidden.
2. **Determinism**: No randomness, no conditional logic based on external state, no AI-driven decisions.
3. **Testing**: All code is testable. Acceptance criteria must pass before code is considered complete.
4. **Simplicity**: No unused features, no speculative logic, no over-engineering. YAGNI principle enforced.
5. **Error Handling**: CLI errors are handled gracefully with clear, actionable error messages to stdout/stderr.
6. **Code Quality**: Python code must be readable, well-structured, and free of unnecessary complexity.

## Folder & Artifact Requirements

The repository MUST contain and maintain:

- **`.specify/memory/constitution.md`** — This document (authoritative governance)
- **`specs/`** — Complete history of all feature specifications
- **`src/`** — Python source code (only Claude Code generates this)
- **`README.md`** — Setup and usage instructions
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — Claude Code operational instructions and guidelines
- **`history/prompts/`** — Prompt History Records (PHRs) for all user interactions

## Quality Standards

All code and artifacts MUST meet these standards:

1. **Spec Compliance**: Code strictly matches approved specifications; no deviations.
2. **No Dead Code**: Every function, class, and variable serves a clear purpose. Unused code is deleted.
3. **Clear CLI Prompts**: User prompts are unambiguous and guide users toward correct input.
4. **Task Identification**: Every task has a unique, human-readable ID (e.g., task-001, task-002).
5. **Status Visibility**: Task status is clearly displayed (complete ✓ or incomplete ✗) in all outputs.
6. **Error Messages**: Error messages are informative and suggest corrective actions where possible.
7. **Testing Completeness**: All acceptance criteria from specs are verified to pass.

## Success Criteria (Phase I Completion)

Phase I is complete when:

1. ✅ All 5 core Todo features work correctly and pass acceptance tests
2. ✅ No manual code editing was performed; all code came from Claude Code
3. ✅ Complete specs exist for all features and align with implementation
4. ✅ CLI application runs successfully from terminal without manual setup issues
5. ✅ Architecture is clean, modular, and Phase II-ready (supports future persistence and API layers)
6. ✅ No code deviates from approved specifications
7. ✅ All PHRs are recorded for full transparency and traceability

## Governance

### Amendment Procedure

- Constitution amendments MUST be documented and justified
- Version numbers follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- MAJOR: Backward incompatible principle removals or redefinitions
- MINOR: New principles/sections added or materially expanded
- PATCH: Clarifications, wording, or non-semantic refinements
- All amendments require ratification before enforcement

### Compliance Review

All PRs and code reviews MUST verify:
- Specifications exist and are approved before code changes
- Code strictly matches specification requirements
- No manual code edits outside Claude Code's generation
- Acceptance criteria pass
- Quality standards are met

### Enforcement

This constitution supersedes all other practices and guidance documents. In case of conflict between this document and runtime guidance (e.g., CLAUDE.md), this constitution is authoritative. Any practice not explicitly allowed is forbidden.
